# TODO (Forward-Looking)

Scope: Items here are intentionally deferred until after Shared1 static library integration and validation.

## 1. Shared2 (WinRT / DLL Component)

Objectives:
- Provide projected (WinRT) surfaces for stable ViewModel & service APIs.
- Encapsulate legacy COM interop behind modern async-friendly wrappers.
- Consolidate DirectX device management and interop helpers.

## 2. DirectX / Graphics Consolidation
- Inventory current `DX` namespace utilities (responsibilities, dependencies).
- Implement abstraction boundary (factory or service pattern) that shields UI from device recreation details.
- Add test harness for device lost simulation (skip gracefully if unsupported environment).

## 3. Logging Enhancements
- Evaluate log volume per channel (heuristic counters in debug builds).
- Add log file size monitoring + rotation policy prototype.
- Introduce optional Telemetry channel (privacy & policy review prerequisite).
- Structured logging: adopt `LoggingFields` for settings persistence and device creation events.

## 4. Performance & Diagnostics
- Add lightweight timing helper (RAII scope logger) integrated with adapter.
- Conditional compilation flags for high-frequency DX diagnostics.
- Explore integration with ETW consumer tooling (trace session guidelines doc).
- Potential Telemetry Channel (deferred): evaluate after core logging adapter integration.

## 5. Reliability / Resilience
- Introduce retry/backoff for settings persistence failures.
- Add watchdog for graphics device resets (log escalation to Warning/Error).
- Unit test harness for simulated failure injection (mock adapter? optional test-only hooks).

## 6. Documentation Roadmap
- Create `graphics-design.md` once DirectX migration starts.
- Create `logging-rotation-design.md` for size governance strategy.
- Expand README with a dedicated "Architecture Overview" after Shared2 surfaces stabilize.
